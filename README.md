# mtg_scripts

Scripts I threw together for various MTG-related products. Yes I'm a nerd.

### Cube compiler script

Idea is to build cube files from a given cockatrice XML file. Generates cube files for https://dr4ft.info/.

Run it like:

```
python3 cube_compiler_script.py -f 'cards.xml'
```

### Cockatrice

Get the XML file by installing https://github.com/Cockatrice/, and copying it over from there.
